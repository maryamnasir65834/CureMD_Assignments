JAVASCRIPT:	var: Variables declared with var are function-scoped or globally scoped if declared
	             outside a function. This means that if you declare a variable inside a function 
		     with var, it is available throughout that function, even if it is declared within
		     a block (like an if statement)

		let: Variables declared with let are block-scoped. This means they are only accessible
 		     within the block they are defined, such as within a loop or an if statement.
		


TYPESCRIPT:	SuperScript of JavaScript. It has additional features that donot exsist in CURRENT VERSION of javascript
		
		STRONG TYPING: We donot need to specify the type of svariable in TS as we do in other programming languages

		Alot of errors can be identified at compile time.
s
		We get intellisence in our code editors.

		At compile time the tyoescrpt editors TRANSPILE the TS code into JS code for browsers to understand it.
